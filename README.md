The repository implements the flexible state-switching Hawkes processes in the paper "Nonlinear Hawkes Processes in Time-Varying System". It includes both simulation and inference.

We recommend to read the tutorial to get familiar with this module. It introduces the key points in the model and illustrates how to perfrom simulation and inference.

For any further details, please refer to the paper.
